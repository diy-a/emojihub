# EMOJIHUB ðŸ‘½

## What is it?

This project is a site that lists all emojis available for easy access.

## Why did I create this?

This was a project I produced to practice how to use data from an external API and fetch them accordingly. It was also a way for me to solidify my JavaScript knowledge.

## How to get it running -
